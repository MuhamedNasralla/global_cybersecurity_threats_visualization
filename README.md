Global Cybersecurity threats (2015-2024) Using Tableau

In a recent class activity supervised by Dr. Eng. Loubna, I worked with the Global Cybersecurity Threats (2015–2024) dataset from Kaggle. Using Tableau, I visualized:

• 	Countries most affected by cyberattacks

• 	Industry-specific financial losses

• 	Types of attacks across the period

This exercise was a great opportunity to practice analytical visualization and explore real-world cybersecurity data.
